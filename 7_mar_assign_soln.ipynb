If an outlier is very high or very low, it can greatly increase or decrease the range. Similarly, the variance and standard deviation are also affected by outliers, since they are measures of how far the data points are from the mean.

The median score would be less affected by the outlier, since it only takes into account the middle score(s). However, the outlier would greatly increase the range and variance of the scores, making them less representative of the typical exam scores for the class."
