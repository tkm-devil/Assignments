    "        Real life example - We all use weather app on our phone. The app doesn't have the capability to predict the weather on its own. Instead, it connects to a weather API to get the most up-to-date weather information. The API provides the app with the data it needs to display the current weather conditions, forecast, and other related information."

In contrast, Web APIs specifically refer to APIs that are accessed over the internet using HTTP. Web APIs use standard HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE to exchange data between systems."
